# Visual-Computing-Augmented-Reality

This project was developed as part of the evaluation of the Computer Vision CS211 Class at EPFL under Professor Dillenbourg

The aim of the project was to develop a game where the user would be able to tilt a green board in his hands and make the board in the game move in the exact same direction. It uses several techniques of Image Processing and Augmented Reality and is built on top of the Processing Software.

## Instructions 

1. Clone the project on your PC

2. Install the Processing Software: https://processing.org/

3. Run the game.pde file that is inside the game folder

4. Enjoy :)

The game starts with a sphere that appears initially in the center of the board. As soon as the user tilts his board, the sphere is going to move in the according direction

Bonus: You can press the shift button on your keyboard to add some additional obstacles. This makes the game a little more tricky but also more fun!
